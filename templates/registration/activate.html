<h2>We're Sorry</h2>
<div>The activation of your registration failed.  This could
be because you have waited too long to activate.  Or if your
account has already been activated, we can't aactivate it
again.  Or perhaps there was an error copying the activation
key from the E-mail we sent (try again if you believe this
is the problem).</div>.
